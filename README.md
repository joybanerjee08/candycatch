# Experimental Candy Catch game made with Spark AR

```Basic Logic : 
  if Mouth is open:
    if Candy is within X distance from mouth's center:
      wait for Y seconds (waiting for mouth to close)
      if Mouth is closed :
        Score !
```

I made this project a while ago, for a Spark AR competition and I was also learning Spark AR at the moment.

Spark AR had a lot of limitations back then so I had to make the best of what I had !

Anyways, feel free to try this out :)
